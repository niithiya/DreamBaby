# DreamBaby

This project was done during the Mid-Career Training conducted by IBM-SGUnited (AI Track)

By using IBM's Garage Methodology, Enterprise Design Thinking (EDT), Agile Methodology and DevOps, we wanted to improve the planning and designing of homes for first-time HDB BTO owners(Users).

Solution: To create an integrated hub for connecting and building trust among customers and interior designers

We came up with a product wireframe (an app of DreamBaby) and how it might look to potential users as well as included cloud architecture and security to reflect the concept of Cloud Computing

Tools used: MockPlus, Canva, Diagrams.net
